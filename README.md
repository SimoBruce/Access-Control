üß© Decentralized Blockchain Application
Overview
This project demonstrates a decentralized blockchain-based application designed to handle secure transactions and data storage within a distributed ledger. Built to highlight key concepts of blockchain technology, this project showcases how decentralization, cryptographic security, and smart contracts work together to establish a transparent and reliable data ecosystem.

The application has several real-world use cases, including financial transactions, supply chain management, and identity verification. By leveraging blockchain, it ensures data integrity and reduces reliance on central authorities, making it resilient to fraud and cyber threats.

üìù Project Features
Decentralized Ledger: An immutable, distributed ledger records each transaction, providing a verifiable history without requiring a central authority.
Proof of Work (PoW) Consensus Mechanism: A consensus algorithm that validates transactions through computational effort, making the system secure against fraudulent transactions.
Smart Contracts: Developed in Solidity, these smart contracts automate and enforce agreements without intermediaries, enabling secure, self-executing transactions.
Cryptographic Hashing: Ensures each block‚Äôs data integrity with unique cryptographic hashes. Each block links to the previous one, forming a secure chain.
Blockchain Explorer: A simple web interface allowing users to view blocks, transactions, and contract states, making the blockchain transparent and user-friendly.
Token Functionality: An optional ERC-20 token standard is implemented to enable digital assets and transactions within the application.
üíª Technologies Used
Blockchain Framework: Ethereum (using Ganache for local blockchain simulation)
Smart Contracts Language: Solidity
Backend: Node.js with Express.js to handle blockchain operations
Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a minimalistic user interface and React.js for dynamic interaction
Database: MongoDB for storing off-chain data (e.g., user profiles and metadata)
Tools:
Truffle or Hardhat for compiling and deploying smart contracts
MetaMask for wallet interaction
Web3.js library to interact with the Ethereum blockchain
Ganache for local blockchain testing and development
